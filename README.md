- Flexbox
- PostCSS, Autoprefixer, CSSNano

### What I learned

This challenge was the first time I had to build and position a colorful background image.

### Useful resources

- [How to buld a device with CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_devices.asp) - This gave me a good starting place for when I had to build the phone. After seeing the code, I felt a little silly that I wasn't able to just figure out how to do it.
